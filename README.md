# MikhaD Dark
After starting to make a theme over 3 years ago and then deciding to just modify `workbench.colorCustomizations` instead, I have finally become fed up with colors clogging my settings.json file and have decided to try and complete this theme.

My goal is a dark, minimal, coherent theme with either purple or dark teal accents. I want the dark shades to differ by consistant Lightness values, and colors to have similar Satuaration and Lightness values.<br>
I have several far from color accurate monitors and I would like this theme to look good on all of them.

## Development
- Press `F5` to open a new window with the theme loaded.
- Open a file that has a language associated. The languages' configured grammar will tokenize the text and assign 'scopes' to the tokens. To examine these scopes, invoke the `Inspect TM Scopes` command (`Ctrl+T Ctrl+M`).

## Installing locally
- To start using this extension with Visual Studio Code run `install.py` and restart VS Code. Then open the command pallet, select Preferences: Color Theme > MikhaD Dark
